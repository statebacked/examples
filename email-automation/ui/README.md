# State Backed email automation example UI

This is a simple example of how a client app might interact with the State Backed backend
state machine we define in [the statebacked directory](../statebacked/).

We won't actually implement the app.
We'll just allow users to log in and then add simple buttons to stand in for the real app actions
of:
- creating documents
- sharing documents
- publishing documents
- creating organizations
- inviting members to organizations
- accepting invitations
- upgrading plans

# Note: you will recieve emails every few minutes for 14 minutes (as defined in the state machine) if you run this
